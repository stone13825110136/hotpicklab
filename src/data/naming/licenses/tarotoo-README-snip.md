## Methodology

All interpretive text was created by Tarotoo within the Rider–Waite–Smith tradition, drawing on established tarot sources — primarily A. E. Waite's _The Pictorial Key to the Tarot_ (1911). Planet and zodiac correspondences follow classical rulerships and the decan system documented in the Golden Dawn's _Book T_, with widely adopted modern associations used for a small number of cards that do not have traditional planetary assignments. Yes/no values draw on widely used modern interpretive conventions and input from tarot experts Tarotoo have collaborated with, based on each card’s upright meaning. Each card was reviewed for consistency in tone, terminology, and structure across the complete deck.

## References

Card meanings and correspondences are informed by established works associated with the Rider–Waite–Smith tradition and related Western esoteric systems:

1. Waite, A. E. (1911). *The Pictorial Key to the Tarot*. William Rider & Son. — primary source for card meanings
2. Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (c. 1888–1897). *Book T: The Tarot*. — astrological and elemental attributions
3. Mathers, S. L. MacGregor (1888). *The Tarot: Its Occult Signification, Use in Fortune-Telling, and Method of Play*.
4. Papus (1889). *The Tarot of the Bohemians*.
5. Ouspensky, P. D. (1913). *The Symbolism of the Tarot*.
6. Thierens, A. E. (1930). *General Book of the Tarot*.

These works were selected for their historical importance and continuing influence on modern tarot interpretation.

## How Tarotoo uses this dataset

When a reading is generated on Tarotoo.com, the meanings of the drawn cards are retrieved from this dataset and included in the model prompt, so interpretations are anchored to these published meanings rather than left entirely to the model. See [`docs/integration.md`](docs/integration.md) for how this works.
